# What is Mira?

The Mira Accelerator fast-tracks the setup of common Amazon Web Services (AWS) Serverless infrastructure<sup>1</sup>. 
It is an opinionated toolkit on top of the AWS Cloud Development Kit.

It enables you to:
- Quickly bootstrap serverless, cloud native AWS applications.
- Set up a CI platform that is configured and ready to use.
- Shortcut a lot of technical decisions; Mira makes them for you.

Mira consists of the following built-ins:

 * A Command Line Interface, that helps to initialise and deploy applications, and also to deploy a CI pipeline.
 * Foundational constructs that simplify configuration of multiple application environments.
 * Bundled AWS CDK.
 * An opinionated set of AWS CDK aspects, e.g. IAM Policy validator. 
 * Complementary sample applications e.g. a simple S3-based web hosting app.
